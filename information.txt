“We believe communication belongs to people, not platforms — we’re building a future where we own our networks, protect our privacy, and connect freely OFFLINE, without dependence on centralized internet infrastructure.”


Problem Statement Explaination:

Today’s digital world is built almost entirely on the internet—centralized platforms, cloud servers, and corporate-controlled infrastructure. While this enables global connectivity, it also introduces serious challenges: loss of privacy, data surveillance, dependency on big tech, single points of failure, and complete communication breakdown during outages or in remote areas.
For millions of offline users, privacy-conscious individuals, and communities seeking true digital independence, there is currently no simple, decentralized alternative to the internet.
Our team addresses this gap by building an Offline Mesh Network — a system that works completely without the internet. Instead of relying on central servers, devices connect directly with one another in a peer-to-peer mesh. Each node strengthens the network, creating a resilient, self-healing, and fully decentralized communication layer.
This enables private, censorship-resistant, and infrastructure-free connectivity for people who value privacy, autonomy, and reliability—whether in remote regions, during network shutdowns, in local communities, or among users who simply want control over their own data.
Our solution empowers offline users with a secure, decentralized network that puts ownership back into the hands of people—not platforms.


🔄 Workflow of the Offline Mesh Network System
Step 1 — App Installation (Initial Internet Use)
The user first uses the internet only once to download the network application. After installation, the system primarily operates offline.
Step 2 — Wallet Creation (User Identity)
Each user creates a wallet that acts as their unique username.
This wallet is based on Ethereum-style mnemonic phrases.
The mnemonic generates two cryptographic keys:
Public Key (for encryption / identification)
Private Key (for decryption / ownership)
Messages encrypted with one key can only be decrypted using its complementary key, ensuring secure communication.
Step 3 — Connection to Pinging Server
After wallet creation, the application briefly connects to a Pinging Server.
This server:
Registers the wallet
Helps generate a unique network address called IPVX
Initializes the user into the mesh network
After this step, the offline system can function.
Step 4 — IPVX Generation (Custom Offline Addressing)
A custom addressing protocol called IPVX is created, inspired by IPv6.
Core properties:
Hexadecimal based
Initial length: 16 bytes
Includes:
Prefix (1 byte): Distinguishes IPVX from standard IPv6
Suffix (binary): Used to identify and connect offline users
Each user is assigned a number from 0–255, converted into a binary byte and appended to the IPVX.
This makes the initial IPVX length 18 bytes.
Step 5 — Network Expansion
When another user connects:
An additional byte is added to the IPVX
IPVX becomes 19 bytes
For every new user joining the mesh, the address grows sequentially by 1 byte
This creates a dynamic addressing structure that reflects network growth.
Step 6 — Offline Mesh Communication
Using IPVX:
Devices connect directly in a peer-to-peer mesh
Each node can relay data for others
No central servers are required
Communication remains encrypted and decentralized
Because IPVX behaves similarly to IPv6, it inherits routing flexibility while operating entirely in an offline environment.
✅ Final Outcome
A secure, decentralized, privacy-first offline mesh network is formed where:
Users are identified by wallets
Communication is encrypted
Addressing grows dynamically
Connectivity exists without traditional internet infrastructure
